I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Economics at Utah State University. My research intergrates social and environmental data to understand the impact of human activities and urbanization on the environment. I rely on econometrics analysis and geospatial programming. My current research focus on hydraulic fracturing activities in the United States.
